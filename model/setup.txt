Thanks for sharing all the details! You're really close now. You're just facing **dependency conflicts** because some **other libraries in your environment** need newer versions of `numpy`, `typing-extensions`, `grpcio`, etc.

---

### 🎯 Your Goal:
You want a **working gesture recognition project with no import errors** for:
- `cvzone`
- `mediapipe`
- `tensorflow`
- and your **hand gesture model**

So let’s lock that down first. Then we’ll isolate it from your other unrelated packages like `langchain`, `pandasai`, etc., which are not needed for this project.

## ✅ CLEAN FIX: Use a Separate, Minimal Environment

Creating a new **dedicated environment** avoids all these messy conflicts. Here’s how:

---

## 🔁 STEP-BY-STEP (A to Z)

### 🔹 Step 1: Create a clean environment (Python 3.9)
```bash
conda create -n gesture-env python=3.9 -y
conda activate gesture-env
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Install only required packages
Use this clean `requirements.txt`:

```txt
tensorflow==2.13.0
keras==2.13.1
numpy==1.24.3
opencv-python==4.8.1.78
mediapipe==0.10.11
cvzone==1.5.6
jax==0.4.13
jaxlib==0.4.13
```

Save it as `gesture-requirements.txt`, then run:
```bash
pip install -r gesture-requirements.txt
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Test the environment
Run this code to check:

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe
import cvzone
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

print("✔ All good!")
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Run your model
Now run your gesture model:
```bash
python test.py
```

It should run **without any DLL load errors**, because:
- MediaPipe `0.10.11` supports Python 3.9+
- No unnecessary dependency conflicts
- DLL issues are resolved in this version

---

### 🔐 Bonus Tip: Don't install `langchain`, `pymilvus`, or `torch` here
Those are for different projects. You can switch between environments like this:

```bash
conda activate gesture-env   # for your gesture project

conda activate langchain-env  # for your AI chatbot project, for example
```

---

Would you like me to give you a `.yml` file to automate all of this in one step too?
